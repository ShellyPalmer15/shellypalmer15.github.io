##What to See and Why
Intel's fifth generation iCore "Broadwell" chips are the company's best yet. They bring along added performance improvements, but more importantly they also bring along battery life improvements. Intel's chips are also powering the smallest and most inexpensive devices on the market, like the $199 HP Stream 11.

Intel is also a major player in The Internet of Things. Intel has designed hardware and software and developed partnerships to help the industry as a whole.
