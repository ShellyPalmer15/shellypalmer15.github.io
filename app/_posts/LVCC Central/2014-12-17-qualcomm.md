Qualcomm is the world leader in next-generation mobile technologies and the worldâ€™s largest manufacturer of wireless chipsets. For more than 25 years, Qualcomm ideas and inventions have driven the evolution of digital communications, connecting people more closely to information and each another.

##What to See and Why
Mobile is a bigger market than ever, and a lot of that has to do with Qualcomm. Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors power many of the market's biggest, best, and most powerful devices. Keep your eye out this year for the latest phone rocking a Qualcomm processor: the top-of-the-line Snapdragon 800. Your smartphone is the anchor that helps connect the rest of the devices in your life. The Smart Home (and the entire Internet of Things) is interconnected through your smartphone, and all of those connections are powered by Qualcomm's awesome mobile processors.
