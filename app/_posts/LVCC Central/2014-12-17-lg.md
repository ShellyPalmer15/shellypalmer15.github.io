##What to See and Why
If you're looking for the most lifelike images on a TV, check out LG's new TV with quantum-dot technology. Quantum-dot tech uses tiny crystals (between 2 and 10 nanometers) to generate light, which helps reproduce colors even better (its color gamut is increased by more than 30%) and more accurate than OLED screens, the current market leader. Quantum-dot technology's been around -- Amazon's Kindle Fire HDX rocks that kind of screen -- but LG's big-screen TV efforts are taking the tech to a whole new new level. Love what you see? LG says the quantum-dot TV will be on sale this year.

LG's got other new TV tech on display, too, like its new line of webOS 2.0 TVs. These units feature better Smart TV integration, and they're 70% faster than previous versions.
