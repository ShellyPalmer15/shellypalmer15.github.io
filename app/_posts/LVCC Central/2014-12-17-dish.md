Consumers want choice, control and ease of use in their entertainment experience. DISH is aggressively responding with industry-leading technology that provides content virtually anywhere. Delivered via satellite or through the Internet, DISH brings entertainment to more than 14 million subscribers.

##What to See and Why
DISH has made a big splash in past years at CES with awesome devices like The Hopper, but this year's innovation offers a true glimpse into the future of the television platform. DISH's most exciting new offering is its Over-the-Top (OTT) video service -- a web-based television platform that DISH wants to charge about $30 per month for. We're watching more and more of our TV on devices other than, well, the TV -- and DISH is right there to keep up with the latest trends.
