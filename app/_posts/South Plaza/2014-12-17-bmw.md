##What to See and Why
You're not going to want to miss the all-electric BMW i3, which was a car designed for today's tech landscape. The i3 has built-in smartphone/smartwatch integration, which means you'll never have to scratch your brain to figure out where you parked; the information will be instantly available to you on your device. After you install the BMW iRemote app on your smartwatch, you can easily track your car's battery state, range, lock status and more from your wrist. One last awesome tidbit: If you hate parallel parking, this is the car for you -- the i3 also has self-parking abilities. One button tap will let the car use its 360-degree sensors to find a spot (and park itself) with as little as 22 inches of extra space.
