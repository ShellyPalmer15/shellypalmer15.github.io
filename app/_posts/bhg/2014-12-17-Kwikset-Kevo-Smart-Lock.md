No more digging for keys? Yes, please! The Kevo turns any Bluetooth 4.0-enabled device into a key that senses you’re in the proximity, and unlocks its deadbolt at a touch of your finger. Send temporary or permanent eKeys to guests or neighbors, too. “How reassuring is it to let a kindly neighbor tuck a package inside the door for you?” Waage says.
