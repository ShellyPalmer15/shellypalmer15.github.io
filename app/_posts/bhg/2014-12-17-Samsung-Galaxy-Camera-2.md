Taking photos and videos today is all about sharing on social media. The Galaxy Camera 2 makes that simple by combining a point-and-shoot camera with an Android mini tablet. Built-in Wi-Fi makes sharing a snap while its 16.3-megapixel images and a 21x zoom produce quality photos and videos worth sharing (and saving) -- no computer download required.
