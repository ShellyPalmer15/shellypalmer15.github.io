Check-engine lights can be serious or nothing at all. Learn without a trip to the shop using the Dash app. Hailed as the "Fitbit for Cars," the app helps drivers know what's going on under the hood. Available in the Google Play Store, and requiring an inexpensive OBD port adapter, Dash offers vehicle diagnostics plus real-time feedback on your driving style. "It's also helpful even when nothing's wrong with your vehicle, as it offers fuel efficiency suggestions, trip logs, and directions to local gas stations," Palmer says.
