If you're sick of your clunky cable box and befuddling remotes, it might be time to try a Smart TV. The Samsung H6350 series offers HD quality picture and the most used features. Its thin profile looks high-end, and a super-simple Smart Hub makes sense of apps and content, so you can easily search the web, stream movies, check social media, watch TV, or play video games. "Overwhelmed by more complicated features and prices? Then don't go there yet; start here," Palmer says.
