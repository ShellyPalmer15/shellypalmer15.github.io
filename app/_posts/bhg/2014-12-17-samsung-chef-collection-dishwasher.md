Dishwasher features can leave you spinning, but this one won't. Samsung's WaterWall system uses a bar of vertical jets to sweep water back and forth rather than spinning in a circle, meaning dishes in every corner get clean. A Zone Booster also lets you target areas for a higher pressure, higher temperature wash. "Finally, a solution for loads that mix sticky pans and delicate glassware," says Jill Waage, executive editor of the Better Homes and Gardens brand. "Plus, a flexible silicone top tray holds hard-to-fit items like microplanes and spatulas."
