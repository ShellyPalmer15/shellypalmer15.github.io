Sometimes it's the little things and sometimes it’s the big (or bigger) things. Offered in 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch sizes, the latest iPhone features make enthusiasts and converts gleeful: HD retina display, autofocus and slow-motion video upgrades, a super-fast processor to soothe impatience, and improved battery life. What’s not to love? "The 6 Plus may be too big for your hand," Palmer says. "It is a two-handed device for almost everyone, so if you're used to one-handing your iPhone, consider the 6 instead."
