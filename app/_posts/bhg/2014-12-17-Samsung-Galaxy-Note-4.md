The Galaxy Note 4's massive 5.7-inch screen puts it in true "phablet" territory. A great choice for entertainment junkies by its size alone, the Note 4 also has the S Pen, a stylus with higher sensitivity levels that offers an elegant way to take notes, sign documents, or navigate the screen without leaving messy fingerprints. "While the screen is bigger than an iPhone 6 Plus, because of the smaller bezel, you can one-hand a Note 4. It's a fantastic device," Palmer says.
