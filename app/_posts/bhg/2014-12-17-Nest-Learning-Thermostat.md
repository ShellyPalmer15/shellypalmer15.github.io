In today's world, most people don't stick to a schedule. Neither does the Nest Learning Thermostat. It's smart enough to know when you're away and lower the temperature after you leave. It can also nudge you to make seasonal changes for additional energy savings -- all while offering monitoring and control via your smart device. "It's a great product that is only going to get more interesting as Nest develops," Palmer says.
