Home security doesn’t have to be complicated. Pella’s Insynctive platform, which debuts in January, has sensors that assure you windows, doors, and the garage door are closed, the deadbolt is locked, and window shades are down. Forget to lower blinds on a hot day? Insynctive’s Bridge is compatible with several home automation systems, so you can tap an app to lower them and save energy while away. “This is a simple entry into home monitoring. Plus, the sensors are affordable and can be retrofitted to almost any window and door,” Waage says.
