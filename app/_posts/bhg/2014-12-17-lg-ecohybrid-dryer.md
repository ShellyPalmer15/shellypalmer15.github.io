This dryer uses heat pump technology to capture and recycle energy, saving up to 50 percent more than conventional electric dryers. "Another drain is the cost of dry cleaning. EcoHybrid's TrueSteam feature reduces wrinkles and odors so you can freshen clothes right at home," says Shelly Palmer, technology and digital media expert. Something on the fritz? Smart Diagnosis lets you troubleshoot the appliance without scheduling a service call. Savings all around.
