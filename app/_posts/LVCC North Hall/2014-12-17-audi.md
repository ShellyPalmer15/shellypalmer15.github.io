##What to See and Why
Last year at CES, Audi showed off an early version of an autonomous car. Since that show ended, Audi has made huge strides in that car's development, and is definitely one of the most notable things to see this time around. The car now features Google Earth integration, along with a fully connected destination search. 

Audi has teased two world debuts for this year's CES that offer a glimpse into the "automotive future." Audi connect, piloted driving, user controls and displays, infotainment, lighting technology... to get a look at the future of the road today, you won't want to miss Audi's booth.
