Ford Motor Company, a global automotive industry leader based in Dearborn, Mich., manufactures or distributes automobiles across six continents. With about 166,000 employees and about 70 plants worldwide, the company’s automotive brands include Ford and Lincoln.

##What to See and Why
With anywhere between 60% and 75% of cars being another device on your mobile data plan by 2020 (at which point about 150 million cars will be connected to the internet), connectivity is the new talking point in the automotive market. Ford is one of the industry leaders, and you'll want to check out its new SYNC 3 communication and infotainment system. Ford made a big splash last year when it announced it was dropping Microsoft for SYNC 3 in favor of BlackBerry's QNX system. 

As connectivity in cars becomes more and more prominent, Ford thought BlackBerry's larger buttons, better fonts, and more advanced touchscreen gestures was a better fit for its cars. That QNX system is a big reason why SYNC 3 has better voice control, faster responses, and an intuitive touch system. Ford's new cars also feature Siri “eyes-free” integration for iPhones and 911 Assist, a free emergency calling system.
