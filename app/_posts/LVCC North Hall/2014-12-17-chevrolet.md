Chevrolet is one of the best-known automotive brands, not only in the U.S., but around the world. The golden Chevrolet bow-tie still stands for iconic design and the spirit of optimism that inspired Louis Chevrolet to emigrate to America more than 100 years ago.

##What to See and Why
Chevrolet's newest vehicles are connected by OnStar 4G LTE, which Chevy calls #TheNew future of connectivity and in-vehicle technology. (It's not as far away as you may think.) The future of the car is a connected one, and Chevrolet's in-car OnStar connectivity plays a major part. With a built-in 4G LTE Wi-Fi Hotspot, your passengers can check email, stream media, and play games on any device they're carrying. Any time your Chevy is on, your hotspot is available and ready to connect to your devices.

That connectivity also serves up enhanced OnStar features -- it's everything you've come to expect from OnStar, plus a 4G LTE connection, "giving you the most comprehensive in-vehicle safety & connectivity system available."
