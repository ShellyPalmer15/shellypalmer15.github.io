	<h3>Screen size gives context to the user experience allowing users to choose how, when and where they want to watch, play and interact in a connected world.</h3>

<p>Only a few short years ago, conventional wisdom held that people preferred to watch long content on big screens and short content on small screens. Today, viewer data confirms that people will watch content of any length on the best available screen.</p>

#Smartphones
####A data center in your pocket
In 2015, your smartphone is still going to be the center of your electronic universe — and, it’s going to know more about you than it ever did before. Smartphones are “the” central data gathering point for your connected life and average users check them about 150 times each day. Of course, we will see new mobile devices this year: wearables, smart cars, smart homes, and more — but, they will all connect to and through your smartphone. So for 2015, yep, there’s still an app for that.




<!-- ##Android Global Domination continues
2014 was big for Android and we expect 2015 to be no different. With almost 85% global market share, new developer tools, and improved OS versioning, companies aiming for the mass market are now opting for "Android first" strategies.

##Android 
- Fragmentation is improving, versions 4.0+ is now 90% of market
- Google Play Store revenue is expected to surpass the Apple's App Store this year
- Android now generates more global ad traffic than iOS

###Google Play vs. the App Store
Although Android has long surpassed iOS in terms of users, Apple has always been able to brag about store revenue. However, that will change soon. According to Radio Free Mobile analyst Richard Windsor, Google Play Store revenue will surpass Apple App Store revenue by 2018. The math is not terribly difficult, Android has almost 85% market share and it's increasing. But it isn't just cheaper hardware prices that is contributing to Android's success, the ecosystem for developers has matured and has leveled the playing field with the once dominant iOS.

###Material Design will give Android a facelift
With [Android Lollipop (v5.0)](https://www.android.com/versions/lollipop-5-0/) and [Android Wear](https://www.android.com/wear/), [TV](https://www.android.com/tv/), and [Auto](https://www.android.com/auto/) about to hit the market, Google used the opportunity to give itself a facelift. At the June I/O conference they introduced [Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/), a unified design language and system for all screen sizes. Unlike Apple's flat interfaces in iOS7 and iOS8, Material Design incorporates material paper-like surfaces with slight gradients, shadows, and textures, as well as real-world physics that are supposed to make interfaces easier for users to navigate. Hate or love it, [the Material design spec](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html), is an example of how brands need to approach a multiscreen world.

##iOS
- iOS 8 adoption considerably slower than iOS6 and i0S7, creating unprecedented fragmentation in iOS for the first time
- iPhone 6’s are outselling iPhone 6 Plus’s 3 to 1 ([Fiksu](http://9to5mac.com/2014/10/06/ios-8-lagging-adoption-iphone-6-uptake/))

###Apple continues to expand the walled garden
At WWDC, Apple announced the [Apple Watch](https://www.apple.com/watch/, [Apple Pay](https://www.apple.com/apple-pay/), and [iOS 8](https://www.apple.com/ios/whats-new/design/). Although iOS8 lacked major design changes, [HomeKit](https://developer.apple.com/homekit/, [HealthKit](https://www.apple.com/ios/whats-new/health/), the Swift programming language, [CloudKit](https://developer.apple.com/icloud/index.html), [Handoff](https://www.apple.com/ios/whats-new/continuity/), and WatchKit, have made the ecosystem better than ever, especially for developers.

Through standardized API's and data collection, HomeKit and HealthKit is supposed harmonize the smart home and health/fitness tracking sectors. As pure hardware updates are harder to come by, Apple is expanding and fortifying the walled-garden around the iPhone.

#Tablets
####Sales are tanking
- Gartner projects over 90 million fewer new tablet purchasers and 155 million fewer tablet replacements through 2018. 
- Unit sales are up 3%, but revenues are down 4% in 2014 [according to the CEA](http://www.ce.org/News/News-Releases/Press-Releases/2014/Consumer-Electronics-Industry-Revenues-to-Reach-Al.aspx)
- Android has 67.7% global market share, iOS 27.5% [according to IDC](http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS25267314)


Tablets sold 80.4M units this year, which is up from last year, but current growth has cratered. By 2017, the rate of annual growth will slow to single digits [according to NPD](http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/07/10/tablet-shipments-decline-for-the-first-time-npd/). Why? The market is getting hammered on two fronts– phones are getting bigger and lightweight laptops are looking more like larger tablets. Without massive hardware improvements and an average lifespan of 3 years, the market is cooling down.

#PCs
###Making a comeback
- Get excited about Windows 10
- Chromebooks are taking over the education market
- Existential Questions: Are PC’s tablets with keyboards or laptops with touch screens?

The PC world continues to be in transition, with the bulk of the market still driven by businesses, and the consumer market struggling to decide whether the future is in tablets with keyboards or laptops with touch screens.

Windows 8.1 was a fixed some of the big problems with Windows 8. Based on the previews of Windows 10, it looks like Windows is going back to basics with this it’s UI and scaling back the mosaic tiles. We expect businesses to skip Windows 8 & 8.1 all together.

Google’s Chromebooks are one of the few bright spots in the PC market. These laptops run Chrome OS, a modified version of Google’e Chrome Browser but with added offline support. With an entry-level price of $199, they are schooling competitors (especially iPads) in the education market. While the idea of inexpensive, mostly cloud based laptops is awesome,  greater adoption hinges on the robustness of the Chrome Web Store and web apps. 

#Television
####Downward price pressure continues   


##4K
Thanks to dramatic price reductions, prices for 4K sets are now in the same ranges as last year’s high-end HD sets. Given the choice, consumers will likely go for the bigger and better.

Since it is extraordinarily difficult to tell the difference between HD and 4K on screens smaller 65” (unless you like to sit really close to your TV), manufacturers are adding in other improvements to 4K models like new contrast and color enhancements to attempt to differentiate them. 

Getting 4K content is a whole other issue. Right now, only over-the-top (OTT) services can stream it. Unfortunately, 4K cable distribution is likely years away. But then again, who watches cable do. 

##Smart TVs
Smart TV  sales increased 29% YoY and continue to grow in market share (54% of all shipments in 2014, 73% in 2016E), but not necessarily because people are seeking out the “smart” functionality per se. Even if they aren’t seeking it out, the connection rates are going up bringing streaming services like Netflix, Amazon, and the other major providers into the home. Samsung is the leader at 29% share (because they are the leader in TV sales), followed by Vizio (24%), Sony (17%), and LG (13%).
