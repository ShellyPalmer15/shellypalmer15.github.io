###Trending Analysis
In the US, there are only two real players in the platform war – Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android.  And the share of each is comparable, with Android having a small lead at about 52% vs Apple’s 45%.

However on a global basis, Android wins hands down with almost an 85% share to Apple’s 12-15% share. Globally, tablets are 65% Android and the majority of new connected devices run Android as well (over 70%).

It is often said that Android’s biggest problem is fragmentation. Unlike Apple, which has control over the hardware and software, Google leaves it to the OEMs to work with each carrier to send updates to their devices. This is a time-consuming process that doesn’t make sense for some manufacturers. They would rather just make a new device. Google is sneaky though...It uses an app called Google Play Services to push out behind the scenes software the normalizes the platform. Android used to have a bimodal distribution with 2.3 and 4.0 and above. As Gingerbread finally leaves the planet, developers can rejoice. 

Android greatest strength is also its greatest weakness--it’s open source mandate. The Android Open Source Project (AOSP) version of the software and what ends up on a Samsung Galaxy S5 are quite different. There are only a handful of devices that run vanilla Android and they account for roughly 3% of the total market. However, Motorola and vanilla android is making a comeback.
