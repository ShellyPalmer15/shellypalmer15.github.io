#Platform Wars
In the US, there are only two real players in the platform war – Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android.  And the share of each is comparable, with Android having a small lead at about 52% vs Apple’s 45%.

However on a global basis, Android wins hands down with almost an 85% share to Apple’s 12-15% share. Globally, tablets are 65% Android and the majority of new connected devices run Android as well (over 70%).

##iOS
- iOS 8 adoption considerably slower than iOS7 and it’s being called the ‘nerd update’
- Apple's new programming language Swift making it even easier for developers to build apps
- iPhone 6’s are outselling iPhone 6 Plus’s 3 to 1
- iPad continues to lose ground to Android tablets

##Android
- 85% Global smartphone market share, 65% Global tablet market share
- Fragmentation is improving, version 4.0 is now 90% of market
- Material Design is Google’s attempt to unify design metaphor across screen sizes and devices.
- Android One should be a massive success in EMEA
- Google Play Store Revenue is expected to surpass the Apple App Store this year
- Android generates more ad traffic than iOS


##Android Global Domination continues
2014 was big for Android and we expect 2015 to be no different. With 85% global market share, new developer tools, and improved OS versioning, companies aiming for the mass market are now opting for "Android first" strategies. 

##Overcoming fragmentation 
It is often said that Android’s biggest problem is fragmentation. Unlike Apple, which has control over the hardware and software, Google leaves it to the OEMs to work with carriers and regulators to send OS updates to devices. This time-consuming process, outlined in HTC’s infographic Anatomy of an Android Update, doesn’t make sense for some manufacturers. Access to updates has become a differentiating factor among OEMs.

To overcome versioning issues, Google has taken drastic steps to shift functionality from the core operating system to an app called Google Play Services. When looking at Android platform version numbers, it makes sense to group everything above version 4.0 together. With this in mind, Android 4.0+ now accounts for 90.4% of devices. 

###Android One
While Apple is concerned with the high-end market, Google is aiming to bring affordable yet powerful smartphones to the rest of the world with the Android One program. It first launched in India and will soon be rolling out to Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Nepal as well as other countries in 2015. 

###Material Design
With Android Lollipop and Wear, TV, and Auto hitting the market, Google used the opportunity to give itself a much-need facelift. At the June I/O conference they introduced Material Design, a unified design language and system for all screen sizes. Unlike Apple's flat design in iOS7 and iOS8, Material Design incorporates material paper-like surfaces with slight gradients, shadows, and textures, as well as real-world physics that are supposed to make interfaces easier for users to navigate. Hate or love it, the Material design spec, is an example of how brands need to approach a multiscreen world.

##Apple
At WWDC, Apple announced the Apple Watch, Apple Pay, and iOS 8. Although iOS8 lacked major design changes, HomeKit, HealthKit, the Swift programming language, CloudKit, Handoff, and WatchKit, have made the ecosystem better than ever, especially for developers.

HomeKit and HealthKit will help standardize smart home and fitness tracking & health API’s. Through standardized API's and data collection, each brings harmony to otherwise fragemented and  chaotic sectors. As pure hardware updates are harder to come by, Apple is expanding and fortifying the walled-garden around the iPhone.
