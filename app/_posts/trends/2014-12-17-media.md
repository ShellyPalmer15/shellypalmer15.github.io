<h3>Renting is up. Buying is down.</h3>
</section>

The purchase of physical media (CDs, DVDs, etc.) continues to decline, and the downward trend is accelerating. Digital media downloads are declining as well. Consumers are increasingly comfortable with “renting” content by paying for access to subscription services — music, movies, TV shows, and even games and books are all moving towards an access model. In short: “renting is up, buying is down.” This may have a corollary effect in the TV and online video markets. The pressure for pay services to unbundle, along with the appearance of overt-the-top (or OTT) services, is causing waves of disruption in the television landscape — the technology is forcing us to redefine “TV.”

Video viewing habits are changing rapidly. There are more [U.S. broadband subscribers than cable subscribers](http://www.multichannel.com/news/technology/cable-broadband-subs-surpass-cable-tv-subs-lrg/383197) for the first time in history. Time spent watching linear TV fell another 15 minutes per day in Q3 (just like it did last year) and viewing SVOD services increased 12 minutes per day. Also for the first time, Americans spent more time looking at their mobile devices than watching their TV [according to Nielsen](http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2014/whats-empowering-the-new-digital-consumer.html). 

##Access vs. Ownership 
New subscription services coming into the market will fuel a shift toward more on-demand viewing. From the content side we'll see unbundled subscription services from WWE, HBO, CBS, Starz, and Showtime. From the operators we'll see packages from Dish (SlingTV), Sony Vue, Verizon. Collectively, these will further complicate an already difficult and frustrating consumer purchase decision.

What’s this really all about?  The content companies (primarily premium subscriptions channels) want to protect their services against Netflix and reach the group that doesn’t yet subscribe to pay-TV services.  The operators are trying to reach a specific audience that their pay services don’t reach. Dish wants to get millennials with a $30-40 package that includes ESPN.  Sony wants to try to woo their PS3 and PS4 buyers (35M systems) to pay for a 75 channel package at maybe $60-75 (not going to happen…). And Verizon wants to create a national package with a number of new channels that are not on traditional pay-TV services. 
<!-- 
Will any succeed?  Probably HBO and some of the other premium services driven by great original content (36% said in a [Horizon Media survey](http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/237098/horizon-media-more-than-one-third-of-consumers-in.html) that they would subscribe to a la carte HBO)...who doesn't love Game of Thrones?.  But they will need to clamp down on password sharing to make it work.  --> 

In the long run, this is the beginning of the dog chasing its tail: unbundle by offering diverse OTT packages, add OTT services to set-top-boxes like Comcast’s X1, then break out the broadband services separately, and rebundle.

#Cord-cutting
Cord-shaving is happening, as is cord-cutting, though it’s not the race to the door some might have you believe. Since 2008, the number of homes with pay-TV has increased 3.77% to 100.7M HH, but the number of non-pay-TV HH have risen 13.6%. 
On average, 74% of HH subscribe to pay TV, 16% have cancelled (at some point, not just recently) and 10% have never subscribed. In 2014, ATT and Verizon added video subs, but all the other pay TV companies lost, and the market evidence is that the primary driver is cost. For those who are cutting the cord, the primary reason stated for doing so is the availability of content from OTT services and on devices that allow  consumers to see content on the TV. According to PwC – number of 18-24 year olds with pay TV subs dropped 6% to just 71% in the last year -->

##Netflix's future
Having reached a subscriber count larger than HBO's for the first time, Netflix is the poster child of new TV services. However, Netflix may be facing a significant crunch ahead.  Their US subscriber base may be capping out, and they have billions due in content fees as well as the possibility of billions of fees related to net neutrality.  [Analysts](http://www.forbes.com/sites/markrogowsky/2014/10/15/netflix-still-mails-dvds-too-but-for-how-much-longer/) have estimated that Netflix will only be able to operate at a 15% margin vs. HBO’s 37% going forward, which raises some serious speculation that there could be some kind of advertising service or sponsorships added to Netflix in the future.

<!-- 59% of US HHs subscribe to at least one SVOD service, with Netflix in the lead at 43% followed by Amazon Prime at 19% and Hulu Plus at 14%. -->

##Best available screen
People tend to watch content on the largest/best available screen. Tablet video views were up 29% last year and smartphone views were up 59%. Interestingly, most of the non-TV viewing is occurring in the home, even if there is a TV available.  Millennials in particular will use their laptop, phone or tablet as a more private viewing experience.

##Connected TV viewing is much bigger than most people realize.
Hulu sees 70% of its viewing coming from devices connected to a TV and Netflix has over 65% (varies based on data source).  The surprising secret is that there are a lot more TVs connected to the Internet than it may appear – include game consoles, streaming media boxes, Smart TVs, Blu-ray players, etc., and the total penetration is massive.

<!-- Game consoles are in over 46% of HHs and 28% use it as their main connected TV device.  At least three quarters use it at least once per week for non-gaming activities and nearly 40% access non-gaming content more than 10 hours per week. Of the HHs with a TV connected to the Internet by a device other than a console, Smart TVs come in second at 20% and small media boxes (SMBs) in third at 12%. While Netflix is available on a wide iOS and Android, it is mostly viewed at home on a big screen. Netflix's 65% connected viewing breaks out to 21% via game consoles/blu-ray players (overwhelmingly game consoles) and 44% on Smart TVs and SMBs. 7% of Netflix viewing is on laptops or desktops and only 7% is on mobile. --> 

<!-- 47% of video consumed on a TV now comes from non-linear sources, which includes time-shifting of linear TV plus other sources like SVOD services.  (Parks).  The primary driver of non-linear viewing is to watch a missed episode of a favorite TV show but for millennials, lower cost and less ads are nearly as important.

As SVOD services grab greater shares of the market, the decline in physical media usage continues - not surprisingly.  There are still 139M people that use DVD or BluRay players, but usage is down 2.4% since last year and 16% since 2011.  And disc sales are off 8%, while rentals in stores fell a full one third - even kiosk rentals are off 11%.  By the end of 2015, streaming services will be a bigger business than all of disc sales and viewers will watch three times as much on streaming as on discs.

The TV is still the primary device for video entertainment of all types or the broad audience (40%) but for millennials, the PC is tops at 37% followed by the TV at 21% and the smartphone comes in third at 17%.  However, for watching traditional TV programming, millennials watch 68% of the time on TV and 19% on their laptop – at the other end of the age spectrum, those over 55 watch 90% of their video on the TV and only 6% on a laptop or PC.

  Binge viewing – a phenomenon created originally by cable network marathons – has become a regular event for consumers, with 42% saying that once or twice a month they watch multiple episodes at one time, and 30% of pay-TV subs say they do it 3-5 times per month.  The favorite device for binge viewing is actually the DVR (43%) followed by traditional pay-TV VOD (19%) and a connected TV device (12%).  And network marathons still count as they rank 4th with 11%.

  Not surprisingly, peak viewing times for video on non-TV devices vary by device – desktop and laptop viewing is primarily during the day and peaks between noon and about 3pm, while tablets look much like TV, peaking in prime time, and smartphone viewing is flatter throughout the day with a slight peak in the evenings. 

  And shifting viewing is even affecting movies – Nielsen says movie attendance by people 12-24 was down 15% in 2014.  Which may have helped create Hollywood’s worst summer in 8 years. – overall attendance in 2014 was running 4.6% below 2013.

#Advertising Shifts
Advertisers spend money where the people are, and that is evident as dollars move from traditional media to digital media. Print in all forms is suffering and even “older” digital media is losing ground as money moves from display ads to online video.  TV is not exempt from this either as money is shifting from traditional TV to “television” as it exists in many new forms. One estimate says $4B in ad buys shifted in 2014.

Allstate, as an example, plans to move 20% of its ad dollars from TV to online in 2015.

And the data-driven buying and selling of online video is finding its way into TV advertising.  Not in auctions or real time bidding – that may never happen – but in the use of data to “cherry-pick” audiences by agencies and advertisers and “cherry-package” audiences by content providers. 

But to be clear, TV advertising still dwarfs digital video spending and all of digital advertising spending for that matter.  When advertisers want large reach with great engagement and exposure, TV is still the top buy.

Connected TV is become a desirable ad destination for buyers – it has TV-like engagement and quality without ad fraud and it reaches the unreachables on TV.  Nielsen will start using audio fingerprinting (ACR) to track SVOD and OTT services, which will make the advertising much easier to buy and sell.

Major digital advertising companies have grown larger than any traditional media.  Google is now larger that any “old media” with nearly $70B in ad revenue – Google alone is as big as half the global TV advertising spend.  And advertising is shifting to mobile as well.  As US digital companies expand globally, they expand their audience but not necessarily their revenue base - Facebook gets 72% of its revenue ($2.7B in Q2) from US, Canada and Europe, but only 38% of the people (1.3B total/mo)

Time-shifting is becoming increasingly important in advertising buying for TV, and for the first time, ad deals are being made around “C7” or total viewing over a 7 day period.  As an example, let’s look at the viewing of FX’s “Sons of Anarchy.”  In 2008 when the show premiered, 77% of the viewing was live and live plus same day was 85%.  By season 6 in 2013, only 43% was live and live plus same day was down to 62%.  31% of the viewing came in days 1-3 and total viewing in the week following a show’s premiere represented 38% of the total audience.

Advertising in long form “TV” content is growing via the Internet.  Total video views grew by 23% last year and ad views by 30%, but advertising in long form video (over 10 minutes) grew by 41%. -->

<h2>Gaming returns to CES</h2>
<p>Gaming is slowly returning to CES after defecting years ago for their own conference - E3.  This year, 637 exhibitors claim to offer gaming or accessories, up from 511 last year.</p>

<p>The game console business continues to grow with the new Xbox One and Playstation 4 consoles outselling their predecessors by about 70% in their first year. Revenue for consoles is expected to hit $4.8Bn for 2014. Sony has sold 15m PS4s since it’s launch, outpacing the Xbox One, which is still up 102% YoY. Premium online gaming is also impressively popular. Although only 8m of Sony’s 55m total Playstation owners pay $50 per year for PSN; half of Xbox's 48m owners pay $60 per year for Xbox Live Gold.</p>
