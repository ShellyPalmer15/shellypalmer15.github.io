##The Zettabyte (ZB) era
####More tubes ;)

- By 2018, there will be nearly four billion global Internet users (more than 51 percent of the world's population), up from 2.5 billion in 2013
- Annual global IP traffic will pass the zettabyte (1000 exabytes) threshold by the end of 2016, and will reach 1.6 zettabytes per year by 2018. In 2016, global IP traffic will reach 1.1 zettabytes per year or 91.3 exabytes (one billion gigabytes) per month, and by 2018, global IP traffic will reach 1.6 zettabytes per year or 131.9exabytes per month.
- Global IP traffic has increased 5x over the past 5 years, and will increase threefold over 3x 5years. Overall, IP traffic will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21 percent from 2013 to 2018.
- 2 internet devices per capita by 2018
- Broadband speeds will nearly triple by 2018. By 2018, global fixed broadband speeds will reach 42 Mbps, upfrom 16 Mbps in 2013.

##The Data Economy
Data is more valuable in the presence of other data, and we desparately need new rules and regualtions to manage, store, and protect our personal and collective information . Many of the "free" apps and services we use aren't actually free at all. In fact, quite the contrary. When we login with Facebook, Google+, Twitter, or even just enter our email, we our trading our data for goods and services. Our data is then grouped, sliced, diced, and sold to advertisers. In other words, News Feed isn't Facebook's best product, we (the users) are.

If we apply Moore's Law, Metcalfe's Law, and the Law of Accelerating returns to the IoT space, we can infer that the hockey-stick-sh growth of new Internet connections will be a data gold rush.

 >Father: "I don't know, we never used 'em!"   
 [laughter]

People often (although not often enough) discuss what our carbon footprint does to our planet. With regards to 2015 and beyond, we'll also need to think about what our data footprint does to our society. Until we can regulate and handle our data, we will continue to live in the wild wild west so to speak. The arms race between hackers and security specialists will never end, but hackers will have an advantage for most of 2015-2017. 

##Smart Home
####'Hey Siri, flush the toilet'

- The ‘smart home’ industry will double in size by 2018, reaching $71B (Juniper)
- Home automation and entertainment systems will drive the 48% of the market, with security accounting for 27% in 2019 according to Strategy Analytics.

The seemingly slow uptake for connected home and smart home technology has more to do with perceived complexity and lack of a clear consumer value proposition than it has to do with the technology. Smart thermostats, clocks, locks, appliances, light bulbs and practically everything else you can think of already exists. What’s missing? Compelling reasons to purchase.

The biggest issue in the smart home space is interoperability. The market is still mostly siloed by manufacturer or chip maker. While ZigBee has firm over advantage when it comes to interoperability, the real players will be Apple and Google (via Nest Labs). Nest began with a smart thermostat, but has spread its “Works with Nest” ecosystem to be compatible with Jawbone, Mercedes, Dropcam, LIFX bulbs, Whirlpool appliances, and most importantly the IFTTT app. Apple fans will enjoy the first approved Apple HomeKit devices in 2015 and we expect them to be massively popular.
