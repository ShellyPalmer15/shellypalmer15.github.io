##The Zettabyte (ZB) era
####More tubes ;)

- By 2018, there will be nearly four billion global Internet users (more than 51 percent of the world's population), up from 2.5 billion in 2013
- Annual global IP traffic will pass the zettabyte (1000 exabytes) threshold by the end of 2016, and will reach 1.6 zettabytes per year by 2018. In 2016, global IP traffic will reach 1.1 zettabytes per year or 91.3 exabytes (one billion gigabytes) per month, and by 2018, global IP traffic will reach 1.6 zettabytes per year or 131.9exabytes per month.
- Global IP traffic has increased 5x over the past 5 years, and will increase threefold over 3x 5years. Overall, IP traffic will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21 percent from 2013 to 2018.
- 2 internet devices per capita by 2018
- Broadband speeds will nearly triple by 2018. By 2018, global fixed broadband speeds will reach 42 Mbps, upfrom 16 Mbps in 2013.

##Smart Home
####'Hey Siri, flush the toilet'

- The ‘smart home’ industry will double in size by 2018, reaching $71B (Juniper)
- Home automation and entertainment systems will drive the 48% of the market, with security accounting for 27% in 2019 according to Strategy Analytics.

The seemingly slow uptake for connected home and smart home technology has more to do with perceived complexity and lack of a clear consumer value proposition than it has to do with the technology. Smart thermostats, clocks, locks, appliances, light bulbs and practically everything else you can think of already exists. What’s missing? Compelling reasons to purchase.

The biggest issue in the smart home space is interoperability. The market is still mostly siloed by manufacturer or chip maker. While ZigBee has firm over advantage when it comes to interoperability, the real players will be Apple and Google (via Nest Labs). Nest began with a smart thermostat, but has spread its “Works with Nest” ecosystem to be compatible with Jawbone, Mercedes, Dropcam, LIFX bulbs, Whirlpool appliances, and most importantly the IFTTT app. Apple fans will enjoy the first approved Apple HomeKit devices in 2015 and we expect them to be massively popular. 


##Connected cars
IHS Automotive: The number of cars connected to the Internet worldwide will grow more than sixfold to 152 million in 2020 from 23 million in 2013.

Morgan Stanley: Driverless cars will generate $1.3 trillion in annual savings in the United States, with over $5.6 trillions of savings worldwide.

All the major car companies are trying to prove to us that they are tech companies.  But the ones that are trying to build their own custom systems are being eclipsed by Google and Apple – the tech guys have not only the chops to make it work, the consumers want their tech from them and not the auto guys as well (58% of consumers polled want their car to support Android or iOS, not a car company system).

In an interesting twist, Ford announced that they are dropping Microsoft for their next version of “Sync” (Sync 3) in favor of Blackberry’s QNX system.  Ford will roll that out to about half it’s lineup in 2016.  They claim to have made the switch to allow better user interaction including larger buttons, better fonts, more advanced touchscreen gestures, etc.  There are about 10M cars on the road today with some current version of Sync.

By 2020, 60-75% of cars will be another device on your mobile data plan, capable of consuming, creating and sharing web based data.  AT&T has the largest number of car companies signed up as partners in connected cars with a total of 8 manufacturers including Nissan, BMW, Ford, Tesla, GM, Audi, Volvo, and GM Europe.  Verizon has half as many with Mercedes, VW, Toyota, and Hyundai.  Projections are that this new connected device will be generating $20B by 2018.  And by 2020, Gartner projects that there will be 150M cars connected to the Internet.
