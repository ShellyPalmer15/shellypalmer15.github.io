Smartwatches are going to be great, but they aren’t here yet. The biggest flaw is and will continue to be battery life; a smartwatch just another thing you need to charge before you go to bed every night. If you start running apps like Run Keeper to track a morning workout, you’ll won’t be showing off your flashy timepiece at cocktail party that night. 

##Fitness Trackers
While the market for fitness trackers has exploded this past year, there is a dirty little secret that most people aren’t talking about: More than half of US consumers who have owned an activity tracker no longer use it. A third of them took less than six months from unboxing the device to shoving it in a drawer or fobbing it off on a relative. This suggests the devices are more for teaching users about their habits than providing daily monitoring. After some time, people learn enough about their activity levels and eating habits to not need a device to monitor their well being. 

##Health 
The global medical wearable electronics market was worth more than $2.8 billion in revenue in 2014 and is expected to cross $8.3 billion in 2019, growing at a healthy CAGR of 17.7% from 2014 to 2019.

Often using similar sensors and computing systems, these are high grade, “professional” devices that are related to specific health conditions.  These include heart conditions, diabetes, blood pressure and much more. The question will be how/if insurance companies and healthcare providers buy in to the devices for both prevention and treatment.
