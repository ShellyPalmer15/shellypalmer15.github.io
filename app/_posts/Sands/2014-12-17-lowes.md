Lowe's is the world's second-largest home improvement company. Lowe's entered the smart home market in July 2012 with the launch of Iris, a cloud-based DIY smart home system that allows homeowners to monitor/control their home from anywhere via smart phone/tablet with a free basic level of service.

##What to See and Why
Iris is a home management system that helps keep your place secure, comfortable, and energy efficient. On a bigger scale, though, Iris brings you and your home closer together. If you're at work and one of your home alarm sensors is triggered, Iris can send you an alert, just like a friend or neighbor. Iris can also make sure your lights are turned off and your thermostat is turned down while you're away, to make sure you're not paying more than you should on your monthly energy bills. Iris also lets you customize your settings, so everything is exactly how you want it when you're at home, at work, on vacation, or wherever. If it's happening at home, Iris has your back.
