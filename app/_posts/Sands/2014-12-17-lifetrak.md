##What to See and Why
LifeTrak wants to help guide you on your path to fitness -- and help you follow your heart. Its line of wearables are designed to help you "listen to your heart" to help you build your path to better health. Each of its wearables precisely measures your heart rate. Its more high-end products add features to help you track your sleep (SleepTrak), how much sun you're getting (LightTrak), and more. LifeTrak also adds form to function, and offers 13 reversible/interchangeable bands for customization on your fitness tracker.
