ABB is a leading supplier of industrial robots, modular manufacturing systems and service. A strong solutions focus helps manufacturers improve productivity, product quality and worker safety. ABB has installed more than 250,000 robots worldwide.

##What to See and Why
ABB is here at CES for the first time, and the thing to see is its RoboScreenR system. The RobosScreen is a graphical screen mounted to the arm of an articulated arm robot, which creates a unique viewer experience by bringing virtually unlimited, 6-axis movement to the video media. The RoboScreen can move in preprogrammed synchronization to video content, music, dance or anything else you want. Make sure you check out its IRB4600 robot with a 75" screen, and its IRB120 with a 20" screen.
