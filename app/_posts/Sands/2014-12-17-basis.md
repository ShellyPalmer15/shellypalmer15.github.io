Basis, an Intel company, is a leader in wearable device technologies for fitness and sleep applications. Basis makes Peak, the ultimate fitness and sleep tracker. Peak combines comprehensive activity and sleep tracking, heart rate during exercise and smartwatch notification in an all-in-one device.

##What to See and Why
The Basis Peak is one of the best wearable fitness devices on the market today. The watch offers 24/7 fitness and sleep tracking, and even monitors your heart rate during exercise without the need for a chest strap. You don't even need to "start" your workout -- the Peak will automatically track your walks, rides and runs. It's the same with sleep; the Peak has automatic sleep detection with sleep stage insights. No wonder Basis calls the Peak "the ultimate fitness and sleep tracker."
