##What to See and Why
Honeywell's products span many different markets, but while you're here at CES, make sure you check out products from its smart home branch. Honeywell's Lyric thermostat was designed to make your life easier. You never know exactly where you'll be all the time... so how is your thermostat supposed to adapt to your ever-changing lifestyle? The Lyric is controllable through a companion app, from anywhere in the world. Plus, it'll save you an average of $66 per year over a traditional thermostat.
