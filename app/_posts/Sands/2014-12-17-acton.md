ACTON is about personal transportation that is lightweight, smart, and fun. We are creator of the Rocket Skates™ - the “World’s First Smart Wearable Transportation” , and the "super-fold" M Scooter.

##What to See and Why
Why walk or bike to work when you can get there with smart electric skates? ACTON's RocketSkates are the world’s first smart electric skates, and they make skating easier than ever; all you have to do is strap on a pair over your shoes and start cruising! The skates communicate with one another to maintain the same speed and behavior, are powered by lithium-ion battery packs. RocketSkates pair with a companion smartphone app, which includes features like route tracking, skate diagnosis, battery status and games.
