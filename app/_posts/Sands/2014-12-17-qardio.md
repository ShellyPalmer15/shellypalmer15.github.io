Qardio is a health technology company creating smart and effective monitoring devices for people who care about their health. Our solutions are based on patent-pending technologies and designs, and include products that are beautifully designed, effortless to use, and leverage the power of Big Data.

##What to See and Why
Qardio wants you to start taking control of your heart. Its QardioCore wearable ECG monitor will help you do just that -- and it's awesome enough to be awarded CES Innovation Awards in the Wearable Technologies and Fitness, Sports & Biotech categories. QardioCore was designed to improve detection of cardiac conditions while fitting easily into your daily life. Launching in Spring 2015, the QardioCore also monitors your body temperature, stress levels and activity tracking. All that data is then transmitted wirelessly to the Qardio App, then into the Qardio Cloud.
