L’Oréal Paris is a leading total beauty care company based in Paris, France. Our main goal is providing affordable luxury for people who demand excellence in beauty.

##What to See and Why
You may think of skincare and cosmetics as a tradtionally "analog" industry, but L'Oreal's world is one fully immersed in digital. Last year, L'Oreal released an app called Makeup Genius, that lets you see what you'd look like wearing products not actually on your face. Whether you're looking for a new lip liner or a new shade of eyeshadow, Makeup Genius reacts in real time to offer a glimpse into the new you. Most important, L'Oreal has spent a lot of time collecting more than 100,000 images to compare how makeup looks in real life, vs. the on-screen portrayal of Makeup Genius.
