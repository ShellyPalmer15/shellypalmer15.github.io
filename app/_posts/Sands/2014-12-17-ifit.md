iFitÂ® is the first technology to unify your activities at home, in the club and outside with a single login. With wearables, apps, and built-in experiences, iFit is the largest connected fitness equipment network in the world.

##What to See and Why
iFit wants to "make your day count." Its wearables track your activity, calories and sleep, whether you're at home or on the go. If you're looking for a simple, easy-to-use tracker, check out the iFit Act. At $49, it's one of the most inexpensive trackers on the market, but still does everything you'd want it to do -- it tracks your steps taken, distance traveled, calories burned, workout time, sleep patterns, and sleep time. If you're looking for a little bit more, the $79 iFit Active adds a display and messaging capabilities to help you stay motivated. Both devices work hand-in-hand with the iFit Track app to monitor your activity and automatically create a workout to complete each day.
