The VERT wearable jump device provides jump rate, jump height and practically any vertical jump measurement data for combines, tryouts, workouts, practices, games or broadcast experiences. VERT is the first wearable technology used during a NCAA broadcast game on network TV.

##What to See and Why
If you want to measure your hops, VERT is the device to use. VERT is a device worn near the waist -- either clipped to your shorts or integrated within clothing, like the VERT active waistband -- that measures your jump, then transmits it to a smartphone or tablet. VERT measures your vertical height, average vertical, highest vertical, total jumps, and more. This single device turned a process that was traditionally available only with special stationary equipment into something that can now be done anywhere, anytime in real-time. Elevate your performance.
