We were designers who couldn't afford a 3D scanner so we made our own. Crowdfunded, we have secured investors and shipped worldwide with new products in development. We help people take their imaginations further by making high quality and well-designed 3D products that anyone can afford.

##What to See and Why
Matter and Form is a company that values not only the engineering and aesthetic features of its 3D scanner, but also its user value -- which is exactly the reason it's easy to see why Matter and Form's 3D scanner is a 2015 CES Innovation Awards Honoree. "The world's first truly affordable 3D scanner" helps you make your ideas a reality and fast track the design process. Matter and Form's scanner creates true 360 degree scanns in a matter of minutes -- and is still compact and portable enough to tuck out of the way when you're not using it.
