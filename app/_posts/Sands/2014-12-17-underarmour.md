##What to See and Why
We now have more tools to better understand our athletes than ever before. Experts from Under Armour know how that tech (and the data it creates) can help coaches and athletes develop and sustain peak performance. Under Armour has put that knowledge to work in its products, like the Armour39 Module & Chest Strap. Armour39 is the first-of-its-kind performance monitor that tracks your heart rate, calories, and real-time intensity. The device also measures your WILLpower: the first true measure of an athlete that boils your workout down to a single score 1.0-10.0. Under Armour says that thanks to Armour39, you won’t just see yourself getting better... you’ll be keeping score.
