                <p>This isn’t accurate, it’s more like one year, and the rate of change is accelerating. But it does speak to the idea of exponential growth.</p>

                <p>The math here is debatable too, but it is very obvious that the value of a network increases with the addition of each additional user, the only question is, by how much?</p>

                <p>This is the least obvious of the three laws, but understanding the exponential rate of technological progress is critical to understanding how consumer behavior is likely to evolve in, what will now feel like, a very short time period.</p>

                <p>There really isn't a breakout product this year. TV manufacturers are trying to come up with new parlor tricks to reverse a slide in sales, auto manufactureers still think they are creating computers with wheels, wearables, 3D printing and smart home companies are still struggling to squeeze their way into consumer's hearts.</p>
