TV guys are still trying to come up with new tricks to reverse the slide in TV sales, auto guys are trying to show the world that they are tech savvy and creating cars as computers with wheels, and the wearables, 3D printing, and smart home guys are trying to squeeze their way into the consumer’s hearts. The show this year is laid out in a new way –Tech East and Tech West. Tech East in LVCC focuses on the more traditional CE markets like TVs, appliances, autos, digital imaging/cameras, etc. Tech East focuses on the emerging technologies like wearables, 3D printing, smart home and similar markets. The big buzz items this year will be 4K TV and online streaming, wearables, smart homes and smart cars, and 3D printing. Not all the buzz is important, but that’s what you’ll be hearing about. The overall CE market has slowed over the last few years from about 7.7% in 2011 to about 2% this year The emerging area however is growing at a rate of over 240% this year and will grow well over 100% again next year – But, this whole emerging market is less than 3% of the whole CE market (about $6B) And as we have seen recently, mobile devices are a huge part of the market with smartphones and tablets making up over 35% of CE revenue CE is a favorite for gifts as always – tablets, computers, TVs, smartphones and game consoles are big holiday items (and they make up 51% of the entire tech spending in 2014) And consumers will be buying online – 54% of consumers will buy their stuff online – but 77% will still be purchased as a traditional brick and mortar store. On interesting addition this year is a new section on unmanned systems – drones are making their way into our grown-up toy wish lists Overview of the four themes Data Center in your Pocket Your smartphone is still the center of your electronic universe – knowing more about you than ever before As these new products come into the world – wearables, smart cars, smart homes, etc., - they all connect to your smartphone And the data that is created and utilized in that provides smarter experiences for each of us through anticipatory computing, and also becomes a new currency that we trade for better ads, lower prices, coupons, and lots more Connection As all these new things try to get into our lives and connect to our smartphone, they generate exponentially greater power for us However, they have to be able to connect – so this year we see the push to interoperability continue and in some cases grow more urgent And with that comes the issues of privacy and cybersecurity. For the first time, there are areas on the show floor for each of these. Content Access vs Ownership The past downward trend of consumer purchases of physical content has reached into digital downloads as well. Consumers are increasingly comfortable with “renting” content by paying for subscription services – partially driven by the universal access those services offer. Music, movies, TV shows, and even games and books are all moving towards an access model and sales of all sorts are falling. In general, media consumption of all sorts is moving to a digital access model, by subscription services, cloud storage, and access via mobile device. This has a corollary effect in the TV and online video markets. The pressure for pay services to unbundle along with the appearance of OTT services is causing many waves of disruption in TV – even down to redefining what “TV” is. The effects on viewing habits, advertising, content production and much more are far reaching and will continue to create new businesses and also confusion for both the industry and consumers for some time. Screens The vast array of screen choices continues. And every screen tries to do too many things. Prices are under pressure, and markets are maturing. Smartphone sales in the US are flattening, tablet sales are flattening, PC sales which have been falling are stabilizing, and new screens like wearables, watches, appliances are finding their way into consumer’s buying. Wearables are popping up everywhere, but the market isn’t really ready yet. There are too many companies trying to rush in with too little differentiation. The trend is important and there is no doubt wearables and smart home, etc. will have a big impact over the next several years. However, this year there are too many wearable offerings with too little differentiation, and smart homes suppliers are still trying to get footing by convincing consumers they really do need a smart doorknob. Devices This year, we are seeing that the major product categories have all reached maturing penetrations. DVD players are in 81% of homes and down a bit, PCs are in over 81% and up a bit, DVRs are at about 50% penetration and nearly flat but usage is falling as viewing shifts to OTT services like Netflix Game consoles are in 46% of homes and nearly flat Broadband is in 78% of homes and nearl yflat But there are areas where there is still a lot of growth Smartphones are in 75% of homes and grew 15% last year (but flattening), Tablets are in 46% of homes and grew 59% last year (but flattening this year) SVOD in 40% of homes and grew 19% Smart TVs are in 13% and grew 78% And homes that have broadband but not pay TV grew 112% to 3% of HHs PC’s The PC world continues to be in transition, with the bulk of the market still driven by businesses, and the consumer market trying to figure out if a lightweight touchscreen notebook computer is really a tablet with a keyboard and if the Microsoft Surface tablet is really a computer Interestingly, the laptop is still a primary screen for millennials. They depend on them in college and take them with them into their lives after college. Together with a smartphone, laptops are standard for millennials (33% penetration) and their content consumption on laptops is huge (83% of millennials use laptops to watch video). Sales for PCs have been falling for several years, and were down 10% again last year. However, through the year, the trend is towards a flattening of the sales curve, and maybe even a hint of an uptick. Again, this may be partly due to the redefinition of laptop PCs Phones We won’t see big smartphone announcements at CES – they are held off for either private announcements or for Mobile World Congress in a few months. Smartphone sales hit 163M units this year, but flattening from double digit historical growth to about 8% in the US. And the average selling price is falling significantly on a global basis. The slowing of the market has hit the manufacturers hard – Samsung took a huge hit in their earnings (mobile profits were off 74%) and moved 500 engineers off phones and into smart homes, Sony is bailing on phone development for China, and so on. LG, however, is regaining share as their shipments were up 40% and their mobile profits increases 87% The iPhone 6 helped Apple gain market share in nearly every market except China, but iOS still is the minority system in the market – globally, Android wins hands down. Smartphone penetration in the US will reach 80% this year, so new purchasers are nearly out of the market - the battle is for new phones and its tough to come up with truly enticing new features in each release. And the global market is still growing – China is already twice the market size of the US. Prices have been falling rapidly for smartphones as well. Since 2010, the global average price for a smartphone has fallen from about $325 to about $250 (almost 25% drop), and is expected to drop to about $200 by the end of 2016. A new connection feature emerged this year – Wifi calling. On an iPhone 6 on T-Mobile, you can set the phone to seamless make and receive calls over wifi and switch back and forth to cellular as you move out of wifi range. This is related to an initiative underway by the cable wifi companies to make wifi “carrier-grade.” And for advertisers, Facebook now allows targeting ads by cellular signal strength – ad units can be selected based on the cellular strength of the viewer Mobile platforms In the US, there are only two real players in the platform war – Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android. And the share of each is comparable, with Android having a small lead at about 52% vs Apple’s 45%. However on a global basis (where it still is pretty much a race between Apple and Google), Android wins hands down with almost an 80% share to Apple’s 12-15% share. Globally, tablets are 65% Android and the majority of new connected devices run Android as well (over 70%). The biggest issue with Android, however, is that the version of Android for each device is not nearly as consistent as Apple has achieved with iOS. There are still 4 versions of Android with significant shares of the market which complicates app design for app producers, but in the last year, that has improved as 80% of the devices in the market now run one of the two latest versions. Tablets There are some tablet announcements at CES, but some are held for Mobile world Congress or private events Tablets sold 80.4M units this year, which is up from last year, but current growth has cratered. Units are up for the year but down 16% in Q4 over last year; and sales revenue is actually down 3% for the full year and 18% in Q4 The market is being disrupted from both ends – phones are getting bigger (“phablets”) and lightweight laptops are looking more like larger tablets. BUT, for the first time this year, tablet sales will exceed TV sales in the US The largest age group buying tablets is 35-49 year olds (49% penetration) One of the key shifts underway for tablets is in the fuzzy space between tablets and laptops, especially for business. The Microsoft Surface Pro has squarely targeted the crossover space with a larger, more powerful tablet, and the expected 12” iPad will be addressing the same market. Internet growth and usage Broadband An important milestone was reached this year – for the first time, Cable MSOs overall now have more broadband subscribers than video subscribers – more about this when we talk about changing viewing habits. When Comcast and Time Warner merge, they will have 30% of the video HHs, but between 35-40% of the broadband HHs The MSOs are now trying to leverage their broadband presence by creating massive “carrier-grade” wifi networks. They are working on a system called WiFi First using a protocol call Passpoint that would let you move from hotspot to hotspot without losing connection – like a cellular handoff. And they are using home broadband modems to create this network – each home modem that doesn’t opt out has a public wifi network – they call “homespots.” They will grow that from about 14% of the installations today to over 70% by 2018. This will not only become a new mobile network, but by being carrier-grade, they will also be able to better support high bandwidth mobile uses like video and games as well as will get approval to support things like health devices The number of homes that take broadband but not TV is growing – 14% of HHs (about 13M homes) now vs 9% in 2011. In fact, 26% of new subscribers to US services subscribe to broadband only vs 22% that take tv services only Traffic on the Internet continues to grow like crazy – annual global traffic will pass one zettabyte in 2016 (that’s 1000 billion gigabytes). Traffic has increase 5x in past five years CAGR of 21%). And by next year, there will be 3 billion users on the Internet. Netflix continues to be the biggest individual source of internet traffic representing nearly a third, followed by YouTube at about half that amount, and general web content at around 11%. Amazon and Hulu clock in at only about 1-2% And by 2018, over half of all Internet traffic will originate from non-PC devices (33% today). It will be led by smartphones, tablets, TVs and Machine-to-machine (smart devices). By 2018, so much video will cross the internet every month that it would take an individual 5 millions years to watch it all! Privacy and Cybersecurity Privacy and Cybersecurity are obviously hot topics these days and for the first time, have their own sections of the show Security breaches are affecting sales of many consumer electronics categories In an Acquity poll, 75% of consumers have said they are less likely to buy wearables due to security issues. Dick Cheney had the wireless connection to his pacemaker removed due to fear of hacking and that someone could literally murder him via the internet. The Sony hacking has raised obvious awareness along with Target, Home Depot and so many more… A new area that has come to the surface on the privacy front – Verizon has been taking some heat for what is called a “perma-cookie.” It is the UIHD- “Unique Identifier Header” – and it is a short term identifier that is attached t data across their network that can be used to target consumers. It cannot be turned off and does an end-around on the “do not track” mechanisms. You can opt out of its use by going to Verizon’s admin and opting out of “Relevant Mobile Advertising” program. Televisions Selling TVs is still a tough business to be in – sales are falling and margins are thin. This year, sales were down about 5% to $18.4B. Which is why manufacturers have tried various new ideas to try to get additional sales. 3D sets – which bombed, and last year curved sets, which are equally unnecessary. Average size of screens continues to go up as 40” sets are dropping in sales, but 45-50” sets are growing from 24% today to 33% in 2017. The big buzz now is 4K (or “UHD”) and smart TVs 4K – for background – increases the resolution of the screen by 4x over HD. Purely on a resolution basis, no one needs a 4K set unless you are buying one over 70”. However, companies are combining other picture enhancing features with 4K to make the picture look better even at smaller screen sizes Biggest driver of sales of 4K sets, however, are rapidly falling prices. Consumer prices for 4K sets have fallen 86% in two years– fastest price reduction in CE history. Best Buy offered a 55” 4K set on Black Friday for $900. With the prices that low, the HD sets will just get nudged out of the market because the 4K sets will be just as cheap. 4K is about 10 years ahead of where HD was in the second year after introduction 4K sets sales were up 500% YoY (not surprising since it is very early in market) and will total about 8M sets globally – China accounted for 60%. Samsung has about 36% of market, LG 15%, and HiSense 10%. 4K sets will be in about 10% of US HH by 2018, and will be 50% of sales by 2024. But how do we get 4K content? The biggest source will be OTT services. Netflix offers 4K for an additional fee on your subscription, DirecTV has a 4K service, Amazon Prime has added a 4K service, some movie services like M-Go, and the Blu-Ray folks are bringing out a new device for 2015 (really? We need another physical medium? Not going anywhere). Amazon Prime is no additional cost for 4K and includes most of their originals, a number of movies, and more coming. Prime works out to be about $8.25/month – less than Netflix’s 4K service at $11.99 For the immediate future, native 4K content will come from OTT sources and delivered by streaming media boxes or smart TV apps. [and some hard drive packages the tv guys throw in at purchase] Smart TVs Smart TV’s continue to grow in market share, but not necessarily because people are seeking out the “smart” functionality. More and more of the manufacturers product line has the functionality built in, and so more get into the market. Even if they aren’t seeking it out, the connection rates are going up and the fact that the functions are in the sets brings Netflix, Amazon, and the other major providers into the home. Smart TV sales increased 29% over 2013, and is expected to grow at about that same rate into 2017. Smart sets were 54% of all shipments in 2014 and will grow to 73% in 2016. Samsung is the leader at 29% share (because they are the leader in TV sales), followed by Vizio (24%), Sony (17%), and LG (13%). Today, 63% of homes have at least one TV connected to the Internet. By 2018, over 190M people will have TVs connected to the Internet either through Smart TV or SMBs While the “smart” part of the Smart TV is not typically the primary driver of a purchase, it is increasingly becoming a factor and the primary reason the features are important to consumers is the abilty to stream video to the set. Streaming Media Boxes Streaming media boxes are making headway as a part of the “cord-cutting” and “cord-shaving” trend. SMBs have made about 20% penetration into US HHs and expected to grow to about 39% by early 2017. In q2 this year, about 6M units sold in US. According to a recent study by Strategy Analytics, the average US home with broadband now has 1.9 connected tv devices, up 28% over last year. The total number of connected tv devices in the US is now estimated at 168M (includes smart tv, blu-ray players, SMBs, game consoles, etc.) Depending on who you believe around market numbers, Roku and Apple are the top two with 33-45% each and Chromecast has about 16% and Amazon Fire under 5%. However, Chromecast usage is fairly low and Apple and Roku get much higher usage. The average price of SMBs fell this year to about $88, mostly due to the entrance of “sticks” into the market from Chromecast, Roku and Amazon. There is a rumor that Walmart will be introducing a stick also under their Vudu brand, but it supposedly, only will provide the Vudu service – which is a non-starter. The ongoing question is what Apple will do in this space – they certainly won’t make a TV (it’s a terrible market) but they could make an important dent as an SMB. There is buzz that there could be a new Apple TV in the next year, but there’s no clear indication of when or what – however, the buzz suggests it might be a combination of an advanced streamer together with a smart home hub, using its HomeKit as it is doing on the iPhone 6 with HealthKit. That could be a big product for Apple. Consumers use these boxes to adjust their viewing – 45-50% of owners use the boxes to supplement their viewing, where 30% (mostly Roku owners) use them instead of watching linear tv.. A significant event recently was the formation of the Streaming Video Alliance to create a set of standards to make the OTT world more consistent and easier for content companies to enter. Viewing Behaviors Viewing of video has changed dramatically and the shift accelerated this year. For the first time ever, American spent more time looking at their mobile devices than watching their TV and 84% use their tablet as secondary TV. Audiences for TV networks fell 13 minutes per day in Q3 while viewing on SVOD services increased 12 minutes a day – so it’s pretty clear, people are using these other services instead of watching traditional TV services. And kids-oriented programming on TV is falling even faster – down 17% YoY compared in November. There are a lot of new services coming into the market that will fuel this shift and create confusion for consumers – WWE, HBO, CBS, Starz, and Showtime from content companies and Dish (NuTV), Sony Vue, Verizon from operators. And there is an independent group called Layer3 which is a startup from a bunch of ex-cable guys who will try to launch in 2015. What’s this really all about? The content companies (primarily premium subscriptions channels) want to protect their services against Netflix and reach the group that doesn’t subscribe to pay tv services. The operators are trying to reach a specific audience that their pay services don’t reach. Dish wants to get millennials with a $30-40 package that includes ESPN. Sony wants to try to woo their PS3 and PS4 buyers (35M systems) to pay for a 75 channel package at maybe $60-75 (not going to happen…). And Verizon wants to create a national package with a number of new channels that are not on traditional pay tv services. Will any succeed? Probably HBO and some of the other premium services driven by great original content (36% said in a survey that they would subscribe to HBO). But they will need to clamp down on password sharing to make it work. CBS – not likely. That’s mostly a negotiating chip. Dish’s NuTV service might find subs in the younger audience for ESPN, and if Verizon has compelling new channels and also offer a wireless (LTE multicast) package, they might. Sony’s is doomed. In the long run, this is the beginning of the dog chasing its tail – unbundle by offering diverse OTT packages, add OTT services to settop boxes like Comcast’s X1, then break out the broadband services separately and rebundle. We’ll probably see a few major content aggregators in the future than will offer packages of traditional tv content along with new online content (even Netflix…). Cord-shaving is happening, as is cord-cutting, though it’s not the race to the door some might have you believe. Since 2008, the number of homes with pay-tv has increased 3.77% to 100.7M HH, but the number of non-pay-tv HH have risen 13.6%. On average, 74% of HH subscribe to pay TV, 16% have cancelled (at some point, not just recently) and 10% have never subscribed. In 2014, ATT and Verizon added video subs, but all the other pay tv companies lost, and the market evidence is that the primary driver is cost. For those who are cutting the cord, the primary reason stated for doing so is the availability of content from OTT services and on devices that allow consumers to see content on the TV. According to PwC – number of 18-24 year olds with pay tv subs dropped 6% to just 71% in the last year Netflix is the poster child of new TV services, having reached a sub count this year that is larger than HBO for the first time. Their original content offerings have been hits at a rate greater than most TV networks and won Emmys for TV content that never appears on a TV network. However, Netflix may be facing a significant crunch ahead. Their US sub base may be capping out – it certainly is slowing. And they have billions due in content fees. One analyst has estimated that Netflix will only be able to operate at a 15% margin vs. HBO’s 37%. Which has also raised some serious speculation that there could be some kind of advertising service or sponsorships added to Netflix in the future. 59% of US HHs subscribe to at least one SVOD service, with Netflix in the lead at 43% followed by Amazon Prime at 19% and Hulu Plus at 14%. TV viewing on devices other than TV sets is a major trend. Tablet video views were up 29% last year and smartphone views were up 59%. Over 33% of all video viewing is done on a smartphone or tablet. It’s mostly about best available screen (if you’re out of the house, you use what you can), but most of the non-TV viewing is occurring in the home, even if there is a TV available. Millennials in particular will use their laptop, phone or tablet as a more private viewing experience. Closely following TV viewing shifts are changes in the social media landscape. While Facebook still dominates the social media market, millennials are shifting their attention to other platforms, with Instagram becoming their favorite along with Snapchat. Now that “parents” are on Facebook, the younger group is moving on… Some interesting viewing behavior statistics: Connected TV viewing is much bigger than most people realize. Hulu sees 70% of its viewing coming from devices connected to a TV and Netflix has over 65% (varies based on data source). The surprising secret is that there are a lot more TVs connected to the Internet than it may appear. – include game consoles, streaming media boxes, Smart TVs, Blu-ray players, etc., and the total penetration is large. Consider: Over 2/3 of US broadband HHs have at least one TV connected to the internet either via a device or directly as a smart TV. Game consoles are in over 46% of HHs and 28% use it as their main connected TV device. At least three quarters use it at least once per week for non-gaming activities and nearly 40% access non-gaming content more than 10 hours per week. Of the HHs with a TV connected to the Internet by a device other than a console, Smart TVs come in second at 20% and SMBs third at 12% While Netflix is available on a wide variety of mobile devices, it is mostly viewed at home. Their 65% of connected TV viewing breaks out to 21% on game consoles or blu-ray players (overwhelming game consoles) and 44% on Smart TVs and SMBs. 27% of Netflix viewing is on laptops or desktops and only 7% is on mobile 47% of video consumed on a TV now comes from non-linear sources – which includes time-shifting of linear TV plus other sources like SVOD services. (Parks). The primary driver of non-linear viewing is to watch a missed episode of a favorite TV show but for millennials, lower cost and less ads are nearly as important. The TV is still the primary device for video entertainment of all types or the broad audience (40%) but for millennials, the PC is tops at 37% followed by the TV at 21% and the smartphone comes in third at 17%. However, for watching traditional TV programming, millennials watch 68% of the time on TV and 19% on their laptop – at the other end of the age spectrum, those over 55 watch 90% of their video on the TV and only 6% on a laptop or PC. Binge viewing – a phenomenon created originally by cable network marathons – has become a regular event for consumers, with 42% saying that once or twice a month they wathc multiple episodes at one time, and 30% of pay-tv subs say they do it 3-5 times per month. The favorite device for binge viewing is actually the DVR (43%) followed by traditional pay-tv VOD (19%) and a connected tv device (12%). And network marathons still count as they rank 4th with 11%. Not surprisingly, peak viewing times for video on non-TV devices vary by device – desktop and laptop viewing is primarily during the day and peaks between noon and about 3pm, while tablets look much like TV, peaking in prime time, and smartphone viewing is flatter throughout the day with a slight peak in the evenings. And shifting viewing is even affecting movies – Nielsen says movie attendance by people 12-24 was down 15% in 2014. Which may have helped create Hollywood’s worst summer in 8 years. – overall attendance in 2014 was running 4.6% below 2013. Note: 44% plus 21% = 65% on the TV Advertising shifts Advertisers spend money where the people are, and that is evident as dollars move from traditional media to digital media. Print in all forms is suffering and even “older” digital media is losing ground as money moves from display ads to online video. TV is not exempt from this either as money is shifting from traditional TV to “television” as it exisits in many new forms. One estimate says $4B in ad buys shifted in 2014. Allstate, as an example, plans to move 20% of its ad dollars from TV to online in 2015. And the data-driven buying and selling of online video is finding its way into TV advertising . Not in auctions or real time bidding – that may never happen – but in the use of data to “cherry-pick” audiences by agencies and advertisers and “cherry-package” audiences by content providers. But to be clear, TV advertising still dwarfs digital video spending and all of digital advertising spending for that matter. When advertisers want large reach with great engagement and exposure, TV is still the top buy. Connected TV is become a desirable ad destination for buyers – it has TV-like engagement and quality without ad fraud and it reaches the unreachables on TV. Nielsen will start using audio fingerprinting (ACR) to track SVOD and OTT services which will make the advertising much easier to buy and sell. Major digital advertising companies have grown larger than any traditional media. Google is now larger that any “old media” with nearly $70B in ad revenue – Google alone is as big as half the global TV advertising spend. And advertising is shifting to mobile as well. As US digital companies expand globally, they expand their audience but not necessarily their revenue base - Facebook gets 72% of its revenue ($2.7B in Q2) from US, Canada and Europe, but only 38% of the people (1.3B total/mo) Time-shifting is becoming increasingly important in advertising buying for TV, and for the first time, ad deals are being made around “C7” or total viewing over a 7 day period. As an example, let’s look at the viewing of FX’s “Sons of Anarchy.” In 2008 when the show premiered, 77% of the viewing was live and live plus same day was 85%. By season 6 in 2013, only 43% was live and live plus same day was down to 62%. 31% of the viewing came in days 1-3 and total viewing in the week following a show’s premiere represented 38% of the total audience. Advertising in long form “TV” content is growing via the Internet. Total video views grew by 23% last year and ad views by 30%, but advertising in long form video (over 10 minutes) grew by 41%. Wearables Wearable computers are growing up from simple electronic pedometers and electronic watches to sophisticated collections of sensors and displays that occupy several different categories. The buzz is a bit ahead of the reality, but this is a category that will have a big impact over the next few years. Fitness wearables that are worn on the wrist are currently the predominant category with a number of current and new entrants expanding the devices monitoring capabilities and adding computational features like automatic identification of your activity – the ability to tell the difference between you playing basketball and running on a treadmill. This category includes some fitness devices that aren’t actually wearable like devices that track you when you shoot baskets. Smartwatches appeared in force in 2013 and in 2014 began to make a real move into the market. Apple’s Watch raised the awareness of most people and has set a high bar, even though it isn’t available yet. These devices have some fitness capabilities in most cases, but are designed to be extensions of your smartphone. And the killer app for smartwatches – notifications. Fashion is as big a driver in this category as function and a number of jeweler and fashion designers are teaming up with tech companies to make designer computers for your wrist, including Tory Burch, Diane von Furstenberg and others. Computing garments are appearing this year, with entries from a number of different companies including Ralph Lauren. These garments are everything from shirts and workout pants to underwear, bras, and socks. Because the cost, size and power consumption of sensors now allow tiny, washable electronics, these garments can monitor a wide assortment of body functions from heart rate to stress level or stride length and quality. Closely related to fitness devices are health devices. Often using similar sensors and computing systems, these are high grade, “professional” devices that are usually related to specific health conditions. These include heart conditions, diabetes, blood pressure and much more. The growth in this area has been and will continue to be rapid because there is demonstrated benefits to the health care industry (meaning lower insurance benefits paid out) and as a result, insurance companies and doctors are starting to use the devices as an integral part of medical care. Fitness trackers have already made inroads in the consumer market and one estimate shows close to 20% of Americans have some kind of fitness device already – on par with tablet adoption in 2013. However, the same study found that a full third of those who purchased a device 12 or more months ago have stopped using it. Which points to one of the key elements of the fitness wearable market – the devices actually do more towards teaching users about their habits than providing a needed daily monitoring. After some time, people quickly learn enough about their activity levels and eating habits to not need to look at the device’s data. New generations like what we see here this year will add advanced monitoring that will likely keep users on board for longer times. Like the app that links to Apple’s Healthkit that will use the Watch to determine your stress level and offer customized short mediations… The biggest obstacles for consumers in purchasing a device are price, privacy concerns, and lack of “actionable” data. 82% are concerned that the devices would invade their privacy and 86% expressed concerns that it would somehow make them vulnerable to hacks. Dick Cheney (wisely) had the wireless access to his pacemaker removed to prevent a hacker from effectively turning off his heart and committing murder via the Internet. Today, Fitbit is the market leader with about a 58% share, followed by Jawbone at 21% and Nike Fuelband at 13%. The introduction of a number of new entrants will steal share for these leaders but also will expand the market. And with the introduction of the Apple Watch, Fitbit devices will no longer be sold in Apple stores, which will undoubtedly affect their sales to some degree. The market is expected to grow from about $5B in 2013 to over $30B in 2018 – a compound rate of over 43%. Even with this growth, however, fitness wrist wearables will remain a niche market – especially as smartwatches begin to provide the most important features fitness bands offer. And wearing more than one computing device on your wrist isn’t likely to be desirable for most consumers. And because we can… there is also the first wave of fitness devices for your pet appearing this year ranging from true fitness wearables for Fido to tracking devices – VC activity in this area is up about 30% this year. Smartwatches Smartwatches have captured the largest share of the wearable market so far with about 47% of the market and is predicted to continue to lead growing to about 57% of wrist wearables sold by 2018, exceeding 68M units. The most influential player in the smartwatch market is very likely going to be Apple, which is projected to own nearly half the total market by 2020. Perhaps a bit aggressive of a forecast, but Apple has clearly dominated markets that it enters in the past and if the Watch delivers on its promise, Apple may indeed own half the marketplace. Most consumers believe that a wrist wearable needs to offer something more that what they already get on a smartphone – 78% said in a PwC poll that they don’t need one of it just does what they already get on their phone. Garments While a newer category to the consumer (and one that will take a bit more education for the consumer to grasp), Gartner predicts that smart garments will be bigger than other wearables in just two years. They estimate that athletic and training garments will move quickly into the market, being led by products like miCoach from Adidas, the E39 Compression shirt from UnderArmor, and a line of training products from Athos. They also predict that by building in environmental sensors, safety and industrial applications will grow – think clothing that senses toxic situations or monitors firefighters during a fire. Digital Health and Wellness Digital health, while riding on the wave of discretionary consumer devices, will grow in response to their applications to improving healthcare and lowering healthcare costs. Studies have clearly demonstrated that by having these devices that monitor specific health conditions in the home allowing doctors to get realtime updates on the patient’s condition, doctor’s office visits decrease, hospital stays decrease, overall health improves, and costs are reduced. Just the number of apps that monitor health conditions have increased by 2x in the last two and half years to over 100,000 in the market. Many of these start with fitness, but devices and applications for specific diseases are growing rapidly. As an example, diabetes is a big area of innovation that expands on the consumer sensor development to address specific health conditions, There are now devices that monitor glucose levels with an adapter that plugs into an iPhone, FDA-approved wireless patches that monitor glucose levels and communicate with an insulin pump that the patient wears, and even scales that help patients monitor potential foot issues which are common to diabetes patients. Smart Home There seems to be a consumer desire for having a “smart home” in concept, but in reality it’s harder to get there than we’d like. For most consumers, the cost and complexity of adding smart devices to the home is still an obstacle in most categories. However some categories of smart devices are beginning to find their way into consumers’ budgets like smart thermostats and smoke detectors. About 20% of homes have or will purchase a smart device for their home in 2015. Unit sales of smart home devices reached about 20M in 2014 and will likely climb about 73% to 36M units by 2017. The most popular categories are what you might expect – energy management (thermostats primarily) and home security leading the way. Coming up behind those two are appliances, door locks, lights, and garage door openers. Besides cost, the biggest obstacle to this market’s growth is interoperablility. Consumers are notoriously resistant to spending money and then having to figure out how to make things work together. As a result, the industry is working towards easier integration standards. Qualcomm led Allseen Alliance is an open source standard that is gaining significant traction, and the long time standard Zigbee is introducing its 3.0 platform that integrates what was four different standards that didn’t work together under the same name. Smart Home devices are making their way into retailers plans as well. To offset falling revenues in TVs and similar devices, both Best Buy and sears are making large commitments to creating smart home sections in their CE sales sections. Best Buy is setting up over 400 stores with a smart home area and will carry over 100 products while Sears is outing sections in 200 of its stores (Sears sales were down 0.7% YoY same store in 2014 but would have been up 1% had it not been for losses in CE). And as mentioned elsewhere, Apple may become a player that will consolidate around its own interoperability with a new Apple TV and HomeKit. eCommerce and Payments Apple Pay has already begun to make a shift happen in mobile payments, adding 6 major grocery chains since launch, gaining support from about 500 banks and is now available in about 5% of all possible US retail locations (about 225,000 stores). In-store mobile payments at McDonalds were 50% Apple Pay in the first month and Forrester projects that mobile payments will triple to $142B by 2019. Not to be outdone, Paypal added support for mobile payments through the Pebble Smartwatch. The penetration of Pebble watches is still quite small, but PayPal will be a competitor in this space given that they already process over $30B in mobile payments. And through it’s Venmo app, has dominated the “send money to someone” market of $700M per quarter. Black Friday demonstrated that retailing and commerce continue to go online and mobile - online sales were up close to 20%. Of that increase, 47% cane from mobile, but interestingly, consumers tend to browse with smartphones and buy with tablets. A third of the online sales traffic came from smartphones but only 13% of sales and tablets only accounted for 14% of the traffic but 11% of sales. Amazon sales were up 25% on Black Friday and Best Buy’s site was crashed three times over the weekend due to volume. And it seems iOS users spend more – the average sale from an iOS user was $127 and for Android it was only $101. Make that mean whatever you want… 3D Printing The market for 3D printers is growing like crazy as process for consumer and pro-sumer models drop. Estimates vary, but the current market is in the $1.5-2.5B range and expected to grow to between $5-15B in the next 4 years. About 75% of 3D printers are now in industrial or commercial applications – maintenance, parts, prototyping, etc. One of the big changes here for consumers in 3D printers is that they are taking on a sleeker, more trendy design. And prices are dropping – 70 micron units are here on the floor for about $600 and 30 micron, high quality units are in the magic $1200 price point (which has been the home PC magic price for many years). HP has announced that is will introduce a printer in 2016 that will print 10x faster than todays machines. Accompanying the printers are new scanners. Handheld and platform scanners are all emerging, with prices as low as $300. Obviously creating the complex documents that define 3D objects requires a lot of skill if done from scratch and so these scanners allow people to “grab” an object and replicate it – think about this – is this a new form of copyright violation? If I scan an object, send the file to someone and they print it, is that priracy? Autos All the major car companies are trying to prove to us that they are tech companies. But the ones that are trying to build their own custom systems are being eclipsed by Google and Apple – the tech guys have not only the chops to make it work, the consumers want their tech from them and not the auto guys as well (58% of consumers polled want their car to support Android or iOS, not a car company system). Half of all vehicle infotainment systems will be Apple’s “iOS in the Car” according to ABI. In an interesting twist, Ford announced that they are dropping Microsoft for their next version of “Sync” (Sync 3) in favor of Blackberry’s QNX system. Ford will roll that out to about half it’s lineup in 2016. They claim to have made the switch to allow better user interaction including larger buttons, better fonts, more advanced touchscreen gestures, etc. There are about 10M cars on the road today with some current version of Sync. By 2020, 60-75% of cars will be another device on your mobile data plan, capable of consuming, creating and sharing web based data. AT&T has the largest number of car companies signed up as partners in connected cars with a total of 8 manufacturers including Nissan, BMW, Ford, Tesla, GM, Audi, Volvo, and GM Europe. Verizon has half as many with Mercedes, VW, Toyota, and Hyundai. Projections are that this new connected device will be generating $20B by 2018. And by 2020, Gartner projects that there will be 150M cars connected to the Internet. Consumers want safety and information systems more than other features: 66% want detection of malfunctioning parts, 60% want real time traffic updates and interest in email, text or social media functions is low. The connected car market will grow by a compound rate of 41% through 2018 reaching almost 60M units and worth $98B. Add-in devices that monitor car performance, safety, location and more are entering the market. Automatic offers a plug in for the standard port in every car that tracks mechanical functions, includes GPS and Bluetooth, can alert the user to a stolen car, can track locations, provide location-based information like parking areas and gas stations, and even remind the owner where they parked their car – for $99 and an app download. Privacy and security have become significant issues as consumers fear a hacker could take control of their car or gather private information about them like locations. To address this, ford has started building in firewalls in their cars and has hired a team of hackers to look for vulnerablilities in their vehicles, and US Auto Trade groups have agreed to increased security measures on car data – this doesn’t protect against hacking, but it’s a start. Gaming The game console business continues to grow with the new Xbox and Playstation consoles outselling their predecessors in the first year by about 70%. Revenue for consoles is expected to hit $4.8B for 2014. Sony has sold 15M PS4s since it’s launch, outpacing the Xbox One. Based on a recent Parks Associate study, about 62% of all US broadband HHs have a game console (80% of HHs with a child in the home has a console), and it breaks out as 35% of US broadband HHs with Xbox and 27% Playstations. And in most of the homes that own a game console, they actually own 2 or more consoles. PC-based gaming is growing even faster than consoles. Primarily because game-outfitted PCs can do many other tasks so consumers will spend the extra on them to get 4K resolutions and more powerful processors. Revenue for PC gaming was expected to hit $21B in 2014. Interestingly, however, the game software business is declining and was down 27% in 2014. That trend is expected to continue into 2015. One again, PC gaming is rising vs. consoles: since 2009, console game software has fallen from $13.6B down to $8.2B, while pc game software has grown from $8.9B to $11.6B. And 0ver 25% of games on consoles are not bought as discs now, but as direct downloads. And an interesting effect of the increasing in downloadable games – this Black Friday, downloaded games doubled over last year, spending 23% more over the four day holiday than last year. Game consoles are increasingly getting subscribers to their premium services. About 8M of Sony’s 55M total Playstation owners pay at least $50 per year for additional content; Xbox has about half of its 48M owners paying $60 a year for premium gaming Mobile gaming continues to grow and open new audiences. Half of the mobile game market is made up of women, where on a third of the pc and console game market is women. Angry Birds has been downloaed over a half a billion times. Mobile gaming generated over $11B in 2014. Valve has announced a live streaming network called Steam Broadcasting which they are targeting to 100M potential viewers – last year over 100M fans watched electronic sports games and 20M tuned in just to watch the finals of Valve’s own game tournament. Robotics Appliances Smart home connectivity is slowly coming to appliances below the highest end models. The issue is that the relative cost of adding computing and connectivity to appliances is high. Most appliances use very dumb controllers and have no connectivity of any kind and so even a simple controller can add a hundred dollars at the retail level. That is coming down with cheaper systems and scale. VR Oculus Rift, Project Morpheus… Unmanned Systems New to CES this year – a section just for unmanned systems: drones Use in film and TV production has surged. The FAA opened the door by allowing their use. They are allowed only on closed sets, in daylight and line of sight under 400 feet, and the operators must have pilot certification. Current buzz that uses drones: OkGo’s new video – one continuous shot from a drone for entire music video “I Won’t Let you Down” – 12M YouTube views A quick survey of devices for consumers found over 12 companies offering drones that allowed you to attach a GoPro or similar camera and are priced from $200 to $5000, with the bulk of the well-outfitted drones costing about $500-700. The fastest growing companies in the space are DJI, Parrot and 3dRobotics Venture capital has invested over $40M in drones, and 4 universities are offered degree programs in drones. And of course, the big consumer concerns are safety and privacy – having drones flying over your house and peaking in your windows. There is even a new area of porn – drones photographing into windows and on deserted beaches…</p></div></div><!-- <footer class="footer">
