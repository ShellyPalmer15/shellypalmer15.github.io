<p>As America’s most trusted home safety brand, First Alert is one of the largest manufacturers of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms and home safety products. At CES 2015 we are thrilled to unveil our new Onelink™ by First Alert suite of connected products.</p><h2>What to See and Why</h2><p>Whether you're at home, at work, or on the go, First Alert wants you to feel comfortable and safe. The Onelink is a touchscreen thermostat that you can control from anywhere through a companion app. That app also lets you monitor your energy usage, helping you adjust your heating and cooling tendencies to save you money. Also make sure to check out the Atom Smoke Alarm. Not only does it detect smoke and carbon monoxide, but its photoelectric sensor can detect slow smoldering fires, and it's proner to far fewer false alarms from triggers like shower steam and cooking smoke.</p>
