<p>Fitbit empowers and inspires you to live a healthier, more active life. We design products and experiences that fit seamlessly into your life so you can achieve your health and fitness goals, whatever they may be.</p><h2>What to See and Why</h2><p>Fitbit is one of the biggest names in the wearable market, and for good reason. The Fitbit Charge measures your distance traveled, steps taken, and calories burn, and can last an hour on a single charge. One step up is the Charge HR, which has built-in optical heart rate sensors that continuously monitor your heart rate. (Fitbit calls this "PurePulse.") Want to go top-of-the-line? Check out the Fitbit Surge, which is Fitbit's first foray into connected watches. Featuring a backlit LCD screen and 8 sensors (including accelerometer, gyroscope, compass, ambient light, GPS, and heart rate), the Surge offers advanced fitness monitoring plus smart notifications, texts, calls and more.</p>
